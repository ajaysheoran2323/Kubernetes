#### ClusterIP

A ClusterIP service is the default Kubernetes service. It gives you a service inside your cluster that other apps inside your cluster can access. There is no external access.

The YAML for a ClusterIP service looks like this:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:  
  name: my-internal-service
spec:
  selector:    
    app: my-app
  type: ClusterIP
  ports:  
  - name: http
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
    protocol: TCP
    
````
If you canâ€™t access a ClusterIP service from the internet, why am I talking about it? Turns out you can access it using the Kubernetes proxy!

Run `kubectl proxy`


#### NodePort

A NodePort service is the most primitive way to get external traffic directly to your service. NodePort, as the name implies, opens a specific port on all the Nodes (the VMs), and any traffic that is sent to this port is forwarded to the service.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:  
  name: my-nodeport-service
spec:
  selector:    
    app: my-app
  type: NodePort
  ports:  
  - name: http
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
    nodePort: 30036
    protocol: TCP
```
